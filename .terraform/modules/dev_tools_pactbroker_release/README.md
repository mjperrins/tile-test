# IBM Garage terraform modules

This repository contains a collection of terraform modules that
can be used to provision an environment in an IBM Cloud or OpenShift
environment.


The modules have been organized into three major categories:
- **cloud_managed** - modules to provision and manage resources in the IBM Cloud environment (clusters, services, etc)
- **generic** - modules that are not specific to any one environment, typically working with kubernetes resources
- **self_managed** - modules that provision/work with self_managed environments (CRC, other non-IBM Cloud managed clusters, in-cluster software, etc)

## How to apply a module

In order to use one of these modules, a terraform script should be created that references the desired module(s). For example, to use the `ibmcloud_cluster` module to provision a cluster, the following would be required:

```
module "CLUSTER_NAME" {
  source = "github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules/cluster/ibmcloud_cluster"

  resource_group_name     = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  cluster_name            = "${var.cluster_name}"
  private_vlan_id         = "${var.private_vlan_id}"
  public_vlan_id          = "${var.public_vlan_id}"
  vlan_datacenter         = "${var.vlan_datacenter}"
  cluster_region          = "${var.vlan_region}"
  kubeconfig_download_dir = "${var.user_home_dir}"
  cluster_machine_type    = "${var.cluster_machine_type}"
  cluster_worker_count    = "${var.cluster_worker_count}"
  cluster_hardware        = "${var.cluster_hardware}"
  cluster_type            = "${var.cluster_type}"
  cluster_exists          = "${var.cluster_exists}"
  ibmcloud_api_key        = "${var.ibmcloud_api_key}"
}
```

where:
- `CLUSTER_NAME` is any name you want for your terraform script
- `source` points to the module folder in this repo
- `${var.xxx}` refers to a variable in your terraform script. All of the variables defined within the module's `variables.tf` file need to be provided a value, either through the terraform script or through a default value in the variables.tf file itself

**Note:** If you want to refer to a specific version of a module identified by a branch or tag within the repo, you can add `ref` to the end of the repo url. E.g. github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules/cluster/ibmcloud_cluster?ref=v1.0.0
